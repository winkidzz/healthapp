        Thanks for taking the time to fill out this feature request!

        Prior to filling out a feature request, it is recommended to open a Synthea Discussion
        to ensure that the desired functionality is something that can't be currently achieved
        with Synthea and that the idea is something that the Synthea team would be willing to
        incorporate.

        Also, please check the [Contributions to Avoid](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/wiki/Contributing#contributions-to-avoid)
        section of the Synthea wiki to ensure your idea is something that fits Synthea's scope.
