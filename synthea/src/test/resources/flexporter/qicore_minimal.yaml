# applicability determines whether this mapping applies to a given file.
# for now the assumption is 1 file = 1 synthea patient bundle.
applicability: true

actions:
 - name: Apply Profiles
   # v1: define specific profiles and an applicability statement on when to apply them
   # v1.1: allow specifying a field from the profile to key off of (ex. mCode TNMPrimaryTumorCategory.code)
   # maybe v2 will automatically infer?
   # some of the challenges to keep in mind:
   #  - what if the resource doesn't conform to the profile yet? 
   #    we should make sure we can take other actions before applying profiles, 
   #    or manually specify where to apply profiles so that we can apply other fixes based on profile later.
